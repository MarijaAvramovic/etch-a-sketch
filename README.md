# etch-a-sketch

In this project, I created a toy(sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch) to practice DOM manipulation skills. 

- I used commit early and often.

- First step is a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs, generated using JavaScript.   

- I Used Flexbox to make the divs appear as a grid in order to practice Flexbox, wrap direction shrink ect

- Mindful of box-sizing: border-box;


- I Set up a “hover” effect with event listeners so that the grid divs change color when the mouse passes over them.  (Adding a new class to the div.
Changing the div’s background color using JavaScript.) This feat is leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.
 
- The button on the top of the screen sends the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the existing grid will be removed, and a new grid is been generated in the same total space as before creating a new sketch pad (limit user input to a maximum of 100).


## Extra credit
Hover efect randomizes the squares RGB values with each interaction and darkens the square by 10%, achieving a fully colored square in only ten interactions.
