# etch-a-sketch

In this project, I will be creating a toy(sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch) to practice DOM manipulation skills. 

I will be using JavaScript methods and CSS and the tools that I have already learned. 

- I will commit early and often! You can reference the Commit Messages lesson!

- Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs, using JavaScript.   
It’s best to put your grid squares inside a “container” div. This div can be written in your HTML file.

- Use Flexbox to make the divs appear as a grid (versus just one on each line). To practice Flexbox!

- Be careful with borders and margins, as they can adjust the size of the squares! box-sizing: border-box;


- link your CSS stylesheet?
 
- add console.log statements in your JavaScript to see if it’s actually being loaded.

- Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them. There are multiple ways to change the color of the divs, including:
Adding a new class to the div.
Changing the div’s background color using JavaScript.

- leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.
- set up event listeners for either of those events as a starting point.


- Add a button on the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. 
- Once entered, the existing grid should be removed, and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (e.g., 960px wide) so that you’ve got a new sketch pad.

- Tip: Set the limit for the user input to a maximum of 100. A larger number of squares results in more computer resources being used, potentially causing delays, freezing, or crashing that we want to prevent.

- Research button tags in HTML and how you can make a JavaScript function run when one is clicked.
-  check out prompts.

- You should be able to enter 64 and have a brand new 64x64 grid pop up without changing the total amount of pixels used.

- Push your project to GitHub!
## Extra credit
Transform the behavior of a square when interacting with the mouse by introducing a series of modifications.

- Rather than squares being the same color throughout the grid, randomize the squares’ RGB values with each interaction.

- Additionally, implement a progressive darkening effect where each interaction darkens the square by 10%. The goal is to achieve a fully black (or completely colored) square in only ten interactions.
The opacity CSS property is useful here.
